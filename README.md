## 🚀 Development & Releases

This project uses an automated release pipeline powered by GitHub Actions. To maintain consistent versioning and high-quality releases, we follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

### Automated Release Process
When changes are merged into the `main` branch, our workflow analyzes the commit messages to determine if a new release is needed:

| Commit Prefix | Release Type | Version Bump | Trigger Release? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `feat:` | **Minor** | `3.0.0` → `3.1.0` | ✅ Yes |
| `fix:` | **Patch** | `3.0.0` → `3.0.1` | ✅ Yes |
| `BREAKING CHANGE:` | **Major** | `3.0.0` → `4.0.0` | ✅ Yes |
| `docs:`, `chore:`, etc. | **None** | No change | ❌ No |

**Smart Filtering**: Changes exclusively to the `docs/` folder, `README.md`, or issue templates will **not** trigger a new extension release, even if they use the prefixes above.

### Building Locally
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Build for Chrome: `npm run build:chrome`
3. Build for Firefox: `npm run build:firefox`
4. Build all (Production): `npm run build`
